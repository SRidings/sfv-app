Street Fighter V Clicky App!

This application has been deployed at: https://sridings.github.io/sfv-app/

The application will render different images of street fighter V characters to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

The application will keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.

The user's high score will also be kept throughout the game

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
